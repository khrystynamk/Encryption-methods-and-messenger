# Encryption-methods-and-messenger

Welcome to Encryption-methods-and-messenger!

Five public-key encryption algorithms are analyzed in this project:

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
Rabin cryptosystem
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
ElGamal encryption system
Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)
Also implemented a messenger using socket and encryption using the ElGamal algorithm.
